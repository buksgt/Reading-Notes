#### What occurred during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer science?
The decline of women in computer science began during the period when personal computers started becoming prevalent in U.S. homes. These computers were mostly marketed to men and boys and were often seen as toys suitable for games and basic word processing. This era also witnessed the emergence of a cultural narrative that portrayed computers as primarily for boys, reinforced by popular movies of the time.

#### Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?
It matters because this early exposure to computers gave males a significant experience advantage by the time they reached college. As personal computers became more common, computer science professors started assuming that their students had grown up with this technology. This assumption put female students at a disadvantage, as they were less likely to have had the same level of access to computers at home. This experience gap made it challenging for women to keep pace in computer science courses, contributing to the declining number of women in the field.

#### When are diversity efforts most successful?
Diversity efforts are most successful when they are fully integrated into a company's culture and operations. This means not only hiring a diverse workforce but also fostering an inclusive environment where all employees feel valued and empowered. Successful diversity initiatives often involve continuous education and training, active promotion of diverse leadership, and the establishment of policies and practices that encourage diversity and inclusion at all levels of the organization. Additionally, success is often seen when diversity efforts are supported by top management and aligned with the company’s goals and values.

#### Why do diverse companies perform better?
Diverse companies perform better because they bring a variety of perspectives, experiences, and skills to the table, which can lead to more innovative problem-solving and decision-making. A diverse workforce can better understand and connect with a wider range of customers, leading to improved customer satisfaction and market reach. Diversity also enhances the company’s image and reputation, making it more attractive to potential employees, partners, and investors. Moreover, a diverse environment fosters learning and growth, helping to retain talented employees and improve overall team performance.

#### Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vice versa.
An example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base is a global technology firm that employs a multicultural team with members from various ethnic, gender, and age groups. This diversity allows the company to develop products with features and user interfaces that cater to a wide range of cultural preferences and accessibility needs. For instance, their software might include language options for various regions, accessible design for people with disabilities, and culturally relevant content. This inclusivity in product design helps the company effectively meet the needs of a diverse global customer base, leading to higher user satisfaction and expanded market reach.
